I was always interested in technology either by learning something new or troubleshooting. 
I find troubleshooting the most satisfying experience. 
It's why I pursued a certification in Computer Systems Servicing in TESDA. I thought it would help me to learn more about computers and technology.
Then there was a time last term when there were 3 of us in a group for the finals in one of my programming classes, 
my groupmates were having a problem getting started on our project. 
They just can’t seem to run the program website we have started on. 
And I helped them to troubleshoot it and they eventually got it working and throughout our project I would keep helping them to troubleshoot an error to keep our project running with no problem as I was doing my own tasks of the project. 
Thankfully, we were able to finish the project on-time and we got high scores from our professor and we were congratulated for a job well done. 
So, I realized it was good I am pursuing a degree related to my interest. 
I was able to use my troubleshooting skills in our project.`,

I saw the importance of testing and documentation in software development. 
It made me more interested in learning about quality assurance and testing. 
I researched more about it and found out that there are different types of testing and methodologies. 
It was a great experience for me as I learned a lot about testing and quality assurance. 
I realized that testing is an important part of software development as it ensures that the software is of high quality and meets the requirements of the users.`,
